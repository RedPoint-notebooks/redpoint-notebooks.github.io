        <h3>1.1 What is Redpoint?</h3>

        <p>RedPoint is a free and open-source computational notebook tool that emphasizes ease of use, multi-language
          support and web connectivity. RedPoint notebooks run in the browser, and allow you to write and execute
          JavaScript, Ruby, and Python code within the same document. This case study will explain the uses of
          computational notebooks in general, detail the design goals and features of RedPoint, and highlight the many
          technical challenges we faced in building a web-native computational notebook and the solutions we devised to
          address them.</p>

        <h3>1.2 What is a computational notebook?</h3>
        <p>Computational notebooks are dynamic documents that combine styled text with runnable code. A notebook is made
          up of modular units called cells. Cells fall into two broad categories: text cells and code cells.</p>
        <h4>1.2.1 Text Cells</h4>
        <p>Each text cell is essentially a mini text editor. Many notebook products support the Markdown language for
          their text cells, which enables many common editor features such as headings, subheadings, lists, and inline
          images. In a typical notebook, text cells are interspersed with code cells, and used to document and explain
          the code in those cells.</p>
        <h4>1.2.2 Code Cells</h4>
        <p>Code cells act as mini code editors, supporting features such as syntax highlighting and auto-indentation. A
          key feature of notebooks is that they are backed by a computational engine, and code written in a code cell
          can be executed in-place. When a cell is executed, information about the execution, such as output or return
          value, is displayed below the cell. Code cells share state across cells, but the implementation is different
          in different notebook products. Notebooks with a data science emphasis often use code cells to render
          visualizations. </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/intro/cells_example.png" alt="text and code cells example" />
          <p>Simple example with a rendered Markdown text cell above a code cell.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>1.2.3 Computational Narratives</h4>
        <p>When you combine dynamic code cells with descriptive text cells it provides the building blocks for what’s
          called a computational narrative. Inline code comments help us make narrative sense of the dense syntax of the
          surrounding code. Computational notebooks elevate the descriptive text of comments to the same level of
          importance as the code itself. Fernando Perez, co-creator of the popular Jupyter Notebook, described the goal
          of computational notebooks as: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “the weaving of a narrative directly into a live computation,
            interleaving text with code and results to construct a complete
            piece that relies equally on the textual explanations and the
            computational components."
          </p>
          <p>
            - Fernando Perez, co-creator of Jupyter Notebooks
          </p>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Image: Sample computational narrative</p>
        <h3>1.3 Uses of Computational Notebooks</h3>
        <p>The traditional use of notebooks is in the field of data science, using computational narratives as an
          enhanced alternative to static presentations of data sets. They enable the presentation of code in a dynamic
          and iterative way --the same way that scientific discoveries are made.</p>

        <p>Jupyter notebooks allow a given cell to be executed multiple times, independently from other cells, to allow
          iterative exploration. This style of notebook is backed by a computational kernel that behaves like a REPL,
          building up program state across multiple cell executions. </p>

        <p>These design decisions support a data science workflow, but the way they handle code state creates
          complicated mental overhead. When code cells are re-executed, the visible state of the notebook can become out
          of phase with the hidden state of the kernel. For example, in JavaScript, cells that contain `const`
          declarations will produce errors if the same cell is run more than once.</p>

        <p>Caption: Hidden state in Jupyter notebooks can lead to confusing results </p>
        <p>As far as the underlying program state is concerned, the variable ‘foo’ has already been declared. This
          hidden
          notebook state can make iterating on code confusing for programmers used to top-to-bottom execution. It also
          limits
          sharing notebooks to people who have experience with the intricacies of Jupyter notebook state. </p>

        <p>Other notebook products such as ObservableHQ use a custom system to link state between cells, and a
          non-standard
          dialect of JavaScript. Although they can enable powerful features, non-standard language dialects are not
          suitable for
          people interested in documenting and sharing vanilla code. </p>


        <h3>1.4 Note Taking Apps for Programmers</h3>
        <p>Most programmers looking to document code choose more traditional note-taking applications to present their
          notes. A
          subset of note-taking apps are focused on programmers, such as Quiver, MedleyNote, and BoostNote. </p>

        <p>BoostNote screenshot</p>

        <p>Note-taking apps support syntax highlighting and other stylization features, although most don’t include a
          full-featured code editor. The key limitation is that note taking apps are not backed by a computational
          engine. Code
          within note-taking apps exist only in a static form, and must be copy-pasted into code editing software to be
          run.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/intro/note_taking_flow.png" alt="note taking workflow" />
          <p>Context switching required for notes about programming.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The other limitation with note-taking apps is that none of the major ones are web-native. For example, in
          order to
          access your Boostnote coding notes on a mobile device you must pay a fee. Quiver is also a paid application
          that only
          supports the MacOS platform. </p>

        <h3>1.5 RedPoint</h3>

        <p>We built RedPoint to bridge the gap between data-science oriented notebooks and traditional note-taking
          applications.
          Like note-taking apps, we wanted to present a clean and simple UI that emphasizes the note contents. We wanted
          to
          avoid the context-switching that traditional approaches require, by letting users run the code they are
          documenting
          directly in their notebook. </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/intro/redpoint_on_spectrum.png" alt="context for redpoint among other notebooks" />
        </div>

        <p>Like other notebook products, we wanted to support the creation of computational narratives, but in an
          environment
          optimized for people interested in documenting and sharing the code itself. Our core goals were to create a
          notebook
          whose program state is immediately obvious and where the rendering of code execution information is
          presentable and
          clear. </p>

        <p>Although Jupyter notebooks support multiple programming languages, each notebook only supports a single
          language.
          Other notebook products such as ObservableHQ and Runkit only support a single language (JavaScript). We
          decided to
          create a notebook environment where different languages could be run side-by-side. Being able to run multiple
          languages with one click in a cell-based environment allows you to compare and contrast different languages
          without
          context switching. </p>

        <p>Multilanguage GIF</p>

        <p>We wanted to take full advantage of being web-native by making note sharing easy, and by offering a
          responsive design
          that allows use on mobile devices as easily as on desktop computers. Another design goal was to support
          interactions
          with APIs and webhooks directly from within a notebook. RedPoint notebooks convert JSON payloads and insert
          them into
          a notebook cell, where it is possible to inspect and interact with the resulting object programatically. </p>

        <p>API demo</p>

        <p>Finally, we wanted to create a tool for other programmers that is totally free and open-source. If you’re
          interested
          in contributing, please contact us! In the following sections of this case study, we’ll detail some of the
          problems we
          encountered in implementing these design goals, and some of the solutions we devised to resolve them.</p>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h2 id="network-architecture">2 Network Architecture</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Where to execute code?</h3>
        <p>Our first major decision was deciding whether to execute user code on the client or server side. The main advantage
          of client-side code execution is that there is no network latency incurred by a round-trip to a server. However,
          browsers only have native support for JavaScript, and any other languages would have to be compiled into JavaScript to
          be run. </p>

          <p>DIAGRAM: pros and cons of client vs server execution </p>
        
        <p>Our experiments with in-browser compilers for other languages showed them to be slow and unreliable. Each additional
          supported language for our notebook would require another in-browser compiler, which would quickly escalate client
          memory usage to unacceptable levels.</p>
        <p>Client-side execution would also rely on the client’s computing resources, and would lead to a poor user experience
          on slower (mobile) devices. Overall, we decided that server-side execution was the best solution. However, executing arbitrary user code on our server presents security and network latency concerns. We devised several
          strategies (link) to mitigate them.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>2.2 Limitations of HTTP</h3>
        <p>Our early prototype used an HTTP POST request containing the user code as its payload. As the script was executed
          server-side, relevant data (output, errors, and return value) was stored in a single JavaScript object, which was
          serialized and returned to the client in the HTTP response. This approach worked fine in basic examples, but had
          drawbacks with more complex code.</p>
        
          <p>This IMG needs updating</p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/network_architecture/async_execution_over_http.png"
              alt="limitations of http for asynchronous user code" />
          </div>
        <p>In the above example using a single HTTP request/response cycle, even though the server processes the first log
          statement immediately, the user has to wait ten seconds for the asynchronous code to execute before seeing any
          results. In order to improve the responsiveness of our application, we needed a connection that would permit the
          server to issue many responses to a single client request. That way, a user could receive real-time feedback as each
          cell of code was run by our server, rather than waiting for the slowest code to execute. </p>

          <p>We considered several other alternatives. We could continually ping the server to check for execution results
            (short-polling), or hold open an HTTP connection (long-polling), but both of these approaches are inefficient.
            Server-sent events would allow our server to issue multiple responses, but do not accommodate true bi-directional
            communication. SSEs also have a limitation of ~6 concurrent connections, which is too few for our use case. </p>

       
        <h3>2.3 Websockets</h3>

        <p>A better fit for our needs was to create a WebSocket connection to the code processing server upon the initial page
          load. The main advantage of WebSockets is that it enables true bi-directional communication between client and server.
          The client initiates the process by sending an HTTP GET request with an `Upgrade` header signaling an intent to
          establish a WebSocket connection. The server issues a response with a 101 status code to accept the request and switch
          the connection to the WebSocket protocol.</p> 
          
          <p>After this initial handshake over HTTP, the client and server communicate
          over a single, persistent TCP connection which allows full duplex communication. The reduced message size due to lack
          of HTTP headers means that WebSocket messages incur less latency.</p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/network_architecture/async_execution_over_websockets.png"
            alt="websockets for asynchronous user code" />
        </div>

        <p>Using the same code example as above, we see the benefit of enabling the server to send multiple messages to the
          client in response to a single code execution request. The first log statement is displayed to the user as soon as it
          is executed, then the delayed log statement inside the `setTimeout` callback is sent later in a separate message. </p>
        
        <p>Another advantage of WebSockets is that it allows us to determine when a user has ended a session. The WebSocket
          connection remains open until a client or server disconnects, causing a ‘close’ message to be fired. By listening for
          this ‘close’ message, we are able to <u>tear down containers </u>(link to teardown section) and conserve our host
          system resources. The trade-off is that using WebSockets introduces some additional complexity to our codebase.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Encryption and Certificates</h3>
        <p>
          Regular HTTP and WS internet traffic use port 80 and send data as plain-text across the internet which is
          vulnerable to interception. In order to increase security, we support traffic using the HTTPS and WSS protocol
          and allow traffic to our server through port 443. This means that all messages exchanged between the client
          and server are encrypted before being transported using the Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security.
          To achieve this encryption, we use a certification generated by a Certificate Authority (CA) to generate a
          domain-validated certificate for our server.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/network_architecture/tls_diagram.png" alt="TLS diagram" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The CA verifies that we are in control of our domain, and issues us a certificate and a private key. When a
          client accesses our server, they are supplied the CA issued public key via the DNS TXT record which they use
          to encrypt all data sent to our servers. Because only our server has the private key required to decrypt the
          data, this provides a layer of security for all transmission of data across the open network.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h2 id="user-experience">3 User Experience</h2>

        <h4>3.1 Cells Share Scope</h4>
        <p>
          In order to process user code server-side, that code must be collected and serialized for network transport on
          the client side. The user code, language type, and ID of a given cell are stored as strings in a JavaScript
          object. Each of these code cell objects is stored in an array of cells, where its index is determined by the
          cell’s vertical position in the notebook.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/processing_user_code/sample_code_state.png" alt="sample code state" />
        </div>

        <p>
          One of our design goals was to provide an experience of state and scope that is consistent with a typical
          development environment. To make sure that code cells share state from top to bottom, we don’t allow running a
          single cell in isolation. Instead, when a given cell is executed, all preceding cells of the same language up
          to and including the executed cell are assembled and sent to the server for processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          By building scripts sequentially instead of allowing arbitrary cell execution order, confusion over notebook
          state and scope is avoided. In the following example, the three cells of Ruby code are concatenated into a
          single script on the server. When the third cell is run, variables declared in previous cells are still in
          scope.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/processing_user_code/shared_cell_scope.png" alt="shared cell scope" />
        </div>

        <h4>3.2 Code Execution</h4>
        <h5>3.2.1 REPL Execution</h5>
        <p>
          Once the serialized user code arrives at the server, we need a way to execute it and capture the output,
          return value and errors generated by the code. Our first thought was to take the approach of Jupyter notebooks
          and run the array of user code strings against a kind of kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of our supported languages has a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) program, which can serve as the
          computational engine that backs our notebook. To create them, we used the <a
            href="https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty" target="_blank"><code>node-pty</code></a> library, which allows
          us to spawn a REPL child process for each of our supported languages. Keeping a persistent REPL process alive
          on our server across code executions would mean simpler server-side code and better computational efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, using persistent REPL means that the current state of a notebook is effectively invisible to the
          user. This doesn’t fit our use case of making notebook state easy to reason about for programmers. Our
          solution was to spawn a new REPL process each time user code is run, creating a blank slate of state for each
          execution.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/processing_user_code/repl_stack_state.png" alt="problem with persistent REPL" />
        </div>
        <p>
          This would seem to be a good way to capture the information that we care about (outputs, return values and
          errors) from user code execution. However, the difficulty with this approach is that the REPL also generates
          unwanted command-line UI artifacts, such as prompts.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/processing_user_code/sample_repl_outputs.png" alt="sample repl outputs" />
        </div>
        <p>
          For our note-taking use case, we don’t want to present unfiltered REPL <code>stdout</code>, which would
          unnecessarily clutter our notebook’s UI. Cleaning up the stdout would require significant parsing unique to
          each language, and this would compound as we add support for each new language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, errors in the user code don’t trigger an error event or halt REPL execution, which can produce
          unexpected results. On the other hand, extracting the return value of the last-executed cell is comparatively
          trivial with this approach, as it is always the last line of the REPL stdout.
        </p>

        <h5>3.2.2 Script Execution</h5>
        <p>
          The other option for executing user code is to write it to a temporary script file, then execute the script
          using the Node <code>child_process.exec</code> method. By setting event listeners on the `stdout` and `stderr`
          streams of the child process, we can capture output and errors while avoiding all of the unwanted command-line
          UI artifacts that a REPL produces. By using a persistent WebSocket connection, as soon as output or errors are
          produced, they are serialized as JSON and sent back to the front end to be displayed for the waiting user.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/processing_user_code/script_execution.png" alt="script execution" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The drawback to this approach is that executing a script doesn’t generate a return value. By combining the
          results generated by both the REPL and temporary script, we have a consistent strategy for capturing return
          values, output, and errors from code execution.
