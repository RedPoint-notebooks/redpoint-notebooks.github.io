          <h3>1.1 What is a Redpoint Notebook?</h3>

          <p>
            RedPoint notebooks are computational notebooks that emphasize ease of use, multi-language support and web connectivity. They allow you to write and execute JavaScript, Ruby, and Python code in the same notebook, and document that code with Markdown.  A RedPoint notebook can make API calls or act as a webhook endpoint, letting users interact programmatically with the response payload directly in the notebook.  This case study will explain the uses of computational notebooks in general, and highlight solutions to the technical challenges we faced in bulding our own notebook.
          </p>

          <h3>1.2 What is a computational notebook?</h3>
          <p>Computational notebooks are dynamic documents that combine styled text with runnable code.  A notebook is made up of modular units called cells. Each type of cell has specific features, and cells of different types can be inserted side-by-side in the same notebook.  Cells fall into two broad categories: text cells and code cells.</p>
          <h4>1.2.1 Text Cells</h4>
          <p>
            Each text cell is essentially a mini text editor. Many notebook products support the Markdown language for their text cells, which uses a form of shorthand to enable many common editor features such as headings, subheadings, ordered/unordered lists, and inline images. In a typical notebook, text cells are interspersed with another cell type, code cells, and used to document and explain the code in those cells.
          </p>
          <h4>1.2.2 Code Cells</h4>
          <p>
            Code cells in most notebooks act as mini code editors, supporting features such as syntax highlighting and auto-indentation.  A key feature of notebooks is that they are backed by a computational engine, and code written in a code cell can be executed in-place.  When a cell is executed, information about the execution, such as output or return value, is displayed below the cell. Notebooks with a data science emphasis also use code cells to render visualizations.
          </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/intro/cells_example.png"
              alt="text and code cells example"
            />
            <p>Simple example with a rendered markdown cell above a code cell.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>1.2.3 Computational Narratives</h4>
          <p>
            Why combine these two cell types in one document?  Computers don’t need prose descriptions to do their work, only clear instructions given in machine-readable form.  Humans, however, have different needs when interacting with code, as illustrated by the existence of code comment syntax in virtually every programming language.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Code comments are descriptions in human language, interspersed with machine-readable code, that help us make narrative sense of the dense syntax of the surrounding code. Computational notebooks elevate the descriptive text of comments to the same level of importance as the code itself. Fernando Perez, a co-creator of Jupyter, described the goal of computational notebooks as 
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “the weaving of a narrative directly into a live computation,
              interleaving text with code and results to construct a complete
              piece that relies equally on the textual explanations and the
              computational components."
              </p>
              <p>
                - Fernando Perez, co-creator of Jupyter Notebooks
              </p>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            One of the primary uses of notebooks is to create this kind of computational narrative.
          </p>
          <h3>1.3 Uses of Computational Notebooks</h3>
          <p>
            The original use of notebooks was in the field of data science, using computational narratives as an alternative to static presentations of data sets.  A typical workflow for a Jupyter notebook would involve storing a large data set in a variable in a code cell, describing the data in a text cell, then using different algorithms or visualization tools to iteratively explore the data in subsequent cells.  
          </p>
          <p>Several design decisions in Jupyter notebooks support this workflow.  First, Jupyter notebooks allow a given cell to be executed multiple times, independently from other cells, to allow iterative exploration. Second, this style of notebook is backed by a computational kernel that acts similarly to a REPL, which keeps track of state across multiple executions.  </p>
          <p>Although these decisions support a data science workflow, they can be hard to reason about because of they way they handle code state.  When cells are re-executed, the visible state of the notebook can quickly become out of phase with the hidden state of the kernel. For example, in Javascript, cells that contain <code>const</code> declarations will produce errors if the same cell is run repeatedly.</p>

          </div>

          <h3>1.4 Note Taking Apps for Programmers</h3>
          <p>Another alternative exists for programmers looking to create a narrative documentation of code. Note-taking applications help users document and present their notes, which can be organized into folders, grouped by tags, and searched by keywords.  A subset of note-taking apps are focused on programmers, the most popular of which are Quiver, MedleyNote, and BoostNote.  </p>
          <p>To support their presentational use case, each of these products has a focus on a clean, simple and readable UI. Some of these apps use the same cell-based design as computational notebooks, and support syntax highlighting and other editor features.  The key difference is that note taking apps are not backed by a computational engine.  Any code notes exist only in a static form, and must be copy-pasted into code editing software to be run.  </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">

          <h3>1.5 RedPoint</h3>
           
          <p>
            We hope to situate RedPoint in the middle ground between data-science-oriented notebooks and note-taking applications.  Like note-taking apps, we wanted to present a clean and simple UI that emphasizes the note contents.  However, we wanted to avoid the context-switching these apps require, by letting users run the code they are documenting right in their notebook. 
          </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/intro/redpoint_on_spectrum.png"
              alt="context for redpoint among other notebooks"
            />
          </div>           
          <p>
          Like other computational notebooks, we wanted to let users intersperse narrative with live computation, but in an environment that is optimized for those learning a programming language. We feel that the ability to run cells in any order is powerful, but can also be confusing. For learners focused on understanding code examples, we decided to trade some computational efficiency in exchange for a notebook where rules of scope and state are familiar easy to reason about. 
          </p>
          <p>
          As polyglot programmers, we have found that comparing several programming languages is a great way to learn about the commonalities that underly all languages.  We wanted to create a notebook environment where languages could be run side-by-side to compare and contrast their syntax and behaviors.

        <div class="chapter">
          <h2 id="network-architecture">2 Network Architecture</h2>
          <h3>2.1 Where to execute user code?</h3>
          <p>
            Our first challenge was figuring out whether to execute user code on the client or server side. The main advantage of client-side code execution is that there is no network latency incurred by a round-trip to a server. However, browsers only have native support for JavaScript code execution, while other languages would have to be compiled into Javascript, which can have performance implications .  Each additional language supported would require another in-browser compiler, which would quickly make the client memory usage unacceptable. Client-side execution would also rely on the client’s computing resources, which vary widely by device. There are inherent security concerns with executing user code on our server, which we discuss <a href="#security">below</a>, but overall we decided that server-side execution was the best fit for our use case.
          </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/client_vs_server_execution.png"
              alt="client vs server execution"
            />
          </div>

          <h3>2.2 Limitations of HTTP</h3>
          <p>
            Our early prototype sent code to our server in an HTTP POST request containing the user code as its payload. As the script was executed server-side, relevant data (`stdout`, `stderr`, and return value) was stored in a Javascript object, which was serialized and returned to the client in the HTTP response.  On the client side, the browser then rendered information under the correct cell by using the response object containing data for the code cells executed.
          </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/network_architecture/execution_over_http.png"
              alt="using http requests"
            />
          </div>          
          <p>
            This approach worked well in basic examples, but there were a few drawbacks to using a standard HTTP request/response cycle. When writing asynchronous code, the user had to wait for the server to evaluate all code before seeing any response from the server.
          </p>

          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/network_architecture/async_execution_over_http.png"
              alt="limitations of http for asynchronous user code"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            In the above example using HTTP,  the user had to wait ten seconds before receiving any response. In order to improve the responsiveness of our application,  we needed a connection that would permit the server to issue many responses to a single client request. That way, a user could receive real-time feedback as each cell of code was run by our server, rather than waiting for the slowest code to execute.  Server-sent events would allow our server to issue multiple responses, but not accommodate true bi-directional communication. SSEs also have a limitation of ~6 concurrent connections, which is too few for our use case. 

          </p>
          <h3>2.3 Solution : Websockets</h3>

          <p>
            Our solution was to create a WebSocket connection to the code processing server upon the initial page load. The client first sends an HTTP GET request with an <code>Upgrade</code> header signaling the client’s intent to establish a WebSocket connection. The server then issues a response with a 101 status code to accept the client’s request and switch the connection to the WebSocket protocol.  After the initial handshake over HTTP, the client and server communicate over a single, persistent TCP connection which allows full duplex communication. 
          </p>

          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/network_architecture/async_execution_over_websockets.png"
              alt="websockets for asynchronous user code"
            />
          </div>

          <h3>2.4 Encryption and Certificates</h3>
          <p>
            Regular HTTP and WS internet traffic use port 80 and send data as plain-text across the internet which is vulnerable to interception. In order to increase security, we support traffic using the HTTPS and WSS protocol and allow traffic to our server through port 443. This means that all messages exchanged between the client and server are encrypted before being transported using the Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security. To achieve this encryption, we use a certification generated by a Certificate Authority (CA) to generate a domain-validated certificate for our server. 
          </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/network_architecture/tls_diagram.png"
              alt="TLS diagram"
            />
          </div>         
          <p>
            The CA verifies that we are in control of our domain, and issues us a certificate and a private key. When a client accesses our server, they are supplied the CA issued public key via the DNS TXT record which they use to encrypt all data sent to our servers. Because only our server has the private key required to decrypt the data, this provides a layer of security for all transmission of data across the open network.

        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
          <h2 id="user-experience">3 User Experience</h2>

          <h4>3.1 Cells Share Scope</h4>
          <p>
            In order to process user code server-side, that code must be collected and serialized for network transport on the client side. The user code, language type, and ID of a given cell are stored as strings in a JavaScript object.   Each of these code cell objects is stored in an array of cells, where its index is determined by the cell’s vertical position in the notebook. 
          </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/processing_user_code/sample_code_state.png"
              alt="sample code state"
            />
          </div>
          
          <p>
            One of our design goals was to provide an experience of state and scope that is consistent with a typical development environment.  To make sure that code cells share state from top to bottom, we don’t allow running a single cell in isolation.  Instead,  when a given cell is executed, all preceding cells of the same language up to and including the executed cell are assembled and sent to the server for processing. 
          </p>
          <p>
            By building scripts sequentially instead of allowing arbitrary cell execution order, confusion over notebook state and scope is avoided. In the following example, the three cells of Ruby code are concatenated into a single script on the server. When the third cell is run, variables declared in previous cells are still in scope.
          </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/processing_user_code/shared_cell_scope.png"
              alt="shared cell scope"
            />
          </div>

          <h4>3.2 Code Execution</h4>
          <h5>3.2.1 REPL Execution</h5>
          <p>
            Once the serialized user code arrives at the server, we need a way to execute it and capture the output, return value and errors generated by the code.  Our first thought was to take the approach of Jupyter notebooks and run the array of user code strings against a kind of kernel. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of our supported languages has a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) program, which can serve as the computational engine that backs our notebook.  To create them, we used the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty" target="_blank"><code>node-pty</code></a> library, which allows us to spawn a REPL child process for each of our supported languages. Keeping a persistent REPL process alive on our server across code executions would mean simpler server-side code and better computational efficiency. 
          </p>
          <p>
            However, using persistent REPL means that the current state of a notebook is effectively invisible to the user.  This doesn’t fit our use case of making notebook state easy to reason about for programmers.  Our solution was to spawn a new REPL process each time user code is run,  creating a blank slate of state for each execution.

          <p>
            This would seem to be a good way to capture the information that we care about (outputs, return values and errors) from user code execution. However, the difficulty with this approach is that the REPL also generates unwanted command-line UI artifacts, such as prompts.  
          </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/processing_user_code/sample_repl_outputs.png"
              alt="sample repl outputs"
            />
          </div>           
          <p>
            For our note-taking use case, we don’t want to present unfiltered REPL <code>stdout</code>, which would unnecessarily clutter our notebook’s UI.  Cleaning up the stdout would require significant parsing unique to each language, and this would compound as we add support for each new language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, errors in the user code don’t trigger an error event or halt REPL execution, which can produce unexpected results. On the other hand, extracting the return value of the last-executed cell is comparatively trivial with this approach, as it is always the last line of the REPL stdout.
          </p>
         
          <h5>3.2.2 Script Execution</h5>
          <p>
            The other option for executing user code is to write it to a temporary script file, then execute the script using the Node <code>child_process.exec</code> method. By setting event listeners on the `stdout` and `stderr` streams of the child process, we can capture output and errors while avoiding all of the unwanted command-line UI artifacts that a REPL produces. By using a persistent WebSocket connection, as soon as output or errors are produced, they are serialized as JSON and sent back to the front end to be displayed for the waiting user. 
          </p>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/processing_user_code/script_execution.png"
              alt="script execution"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            The drawback to this approach is that executing a script doesn’t generate a return value.  By combining the results generated by both the REPL and temporary script, we have a consistent strategy for capturing return values, output, and errors from code execution.            
          </p>
